# StartOStartOver app was innitially designed and created on Azure android studio platform
with the of use attribute such as, 2 buttons, text view and plain text as well as an image
One button may be used to create a link betten texview and palin text
while the othe one may be use to clear text on plaintext
Plaintext is mainly for user to inset text , for example Age in this app context
Plainview is used to display text on the app when the user insert a text on textview
The image is to give my app a nice design and was created with the use of drawables and common attributes
Backround colour was also chenge in text style backround, also for a more clearer, brighter and colourful designg
Backround colour also makes the app text more and aesily readable
All the above mensioned was crested on activity MXL with the use o mxl attributes.
The next step was coding or creating functionality of the above mensioned design.
I made the functionality of start over app on Main ativity 
I used the Kotlin language to create my app functionality 
I had to first create variable for each attributes, button, textview and plain text
Then followed onclick functionality create for the button
I then followed with creating a toast string functionality which pops up on the app
The next step was to create variables for textview as well as plain text
That was done so the last step could be done successfully
The final step was to code or create string variables which are what i desplayed on the app when the use 
inputs text on plaintext and click the Match age button
I used the if statement to create my app fuctionality
When the user input ages between 20 and 100, their age is displayed on textview with the the famous person in hsistory who died
when they were the same age.
In the same text, that particular famous person is briefly decribed who they were and tha what they were famous for
When the user inputs ages less than 20 and more than 100 years, the error" No age match, please try ages betwen 20 and 100" displays.
